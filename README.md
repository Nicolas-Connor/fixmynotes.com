# PDF_Splitter_web

This flask webapp  attempts to do away with "4 slides in a single slide" notes sometimes used by university profesors. It is particularly painful to zoom 4 times per slide in order to study! Just upload the pdf you wish to transform into single slide per page document. See the files in ```example_input_and_output``` to see what I mean by "4 slides in a single slide". The webapp can be used [here](http://fixmynotes.com). The project can also be used locally with more flexibility in this [repository.](https://github.com/mariowr2/PDF_Splitter)
